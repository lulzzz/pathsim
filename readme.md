# Pathsim
Pathsim is playground for different path planning algorithms. Due to its focus on learning how the different algorithms work, I decided to use Javascript/Html.

2. We need a map
3. Add obstacles to the map
4. Add these obstacles via use input
5. Implement Dijkstra
6. Implement A*
7. Moveable Objects
8. Cost visualization
9. Step Execution

## Todos
1. Fix Bugs
2. Robot
3. GitHub Repo

## Tests
Run all tests:
- npm test

- npm install watch -g

than type:
- npm run watch-test
